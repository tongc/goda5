America options can be exercised before the expiry date but European options can only be exercised on expiry date

You can purchase a put or call bid/offer option
e.g. An option contract is for 100 Google shares with expiry date 01/01/2023, 
this option can be a put option which means people who bought this option contract have the right to buy google 100 shares at pre-agreed price in the option contract 
this option can be a call option which means people who bought this option contract have the right to sell google 100 shares at pre-agreed price in the option contract
Of course if you have bought this option, you have the right to sell this option. When you buy an option it is called bid and when you sell an option it is called offer
The price for buying options are different depends on what price has been given for the underlier in the option contract. Generally you spend more money for a call option contract if the underlier is lower than the real market price, however the price of the option contract + the price of the underlier for call option contracts is always lower than the current market price of the underlier
